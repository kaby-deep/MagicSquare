# MagicSquare

If you’re a fan of math and logic puzzles like Sudoku or Kenken, then trying to solve a magic square is the perfect little challenge to try out. A magic square is a grid of numbers where each row, column, and diagonal add up to the same sum. How you solve your magic square depends on the size of the puzzle, but they each have easy instructions for filling them in.

Things You Should Know:

> A magic square is a square grid of numbers where each row, column, and diagonal add up to the same total.
> Find the “magic constant” sum of each row, column, and diagonal with S=n[(n^2 + 1)/2]  where n is the number of squares in each row.
> Use a solving technique based on the size of the magic square and how many boxes are in each row or column.


Magic squares have rows, columns, and diagonals that total the same sum.
Each number in a magic square fits into a cell on a grid. The number of rows or columns determines the order, so an “order 3” magic square is one with a 3 x 3 grid. When you add up the numbers in a column, the value is called the “magic constant,” and all the other columns, rows, and diagonals will add up to that number.[1]
A normal magic square has consecutive numbers from 1 to n^2 (where n equals the order). 

A normal order 3 magic square with a magic constant of 15 would be:
8 – 1 – 6
3 – 5 – 7
4 – 9 – 2

On a non-normal magic square, the lowest number may be higher than 1. A non-normal order 4 magic square with a magic constant of 87 could be:
21 – 24 – 28 – 14
27 – 15 – 20 – 25
16 – 30 – 22 – 19
23 – 18 – 17 – 29
